## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like I definitely wait too long to ask questions and need to set a timer when I am stuck on something.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It definitely feels a little uncomfortable at first going off solo on things but I'm sure we will be doing a lot of that in the near future.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

If I go to the gym now I will be happy later. If I eat ice cream now I will be happy now and regret it later.

If someone is old enough to enter a website.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

It goes line by line until one is true and then does what the statement says to do.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The and && for both or, the || or symbols for one.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions? None right now.
