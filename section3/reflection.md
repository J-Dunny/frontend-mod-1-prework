## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Your capabilities are not set and anything you choose to work on can grow. Always have a positive, never going to quit attitude.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I am always trying to learn new things and better myself. Both professionally and in sports and just life in general. I definitely need to work on my organization and planning skills.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Arrays are basically just a list of anything. So I would guess that when you click on someone profile pictures that basically you are seeing an array of all of their pictures that they have uploaded.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
A pre made JavaScript method that we can use to manipulate the data in arrays.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
To make the computer do a certain thing multiple times. We could use a loop to iterate through an array. Or we could just have the loop run a certain number of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A process that repeats over and over until it gets a certain job done like hammering in a nail.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops? None so far.
