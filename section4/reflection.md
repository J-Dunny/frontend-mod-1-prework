## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I tend to work almost already very similar to the Pomodoro technique as it is so I really like it and feel very productive.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)? I felt very focused and got a section of work done in about 25-30 min. Got up for a cup of coffee or snack and then got back into it and repeated until everything was finished.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript? An Object is a complex data structure that can be used like a cookie cutter to create many instances of itself. It is different than an array in the fact that it can hold methods inside of it and also create instances.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class- object: to save things like, name, age, class. These things will change.
  * List of states and their capitals- array: Because these wont change.
  * List of things to pack for vacation- array: Because it is just a basic list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow- object: save information like, following, comments to each other, photos ect.
  * List of student names and their cohort- I would make an array per cohort and save all the names in that array.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake- Object to save multiple kinds of cakes
  * All my favorite restaurants- array as a simple list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Facebook posts

keys values
who posted = name
time posted = time
who can see = public




1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects? Good for now!
